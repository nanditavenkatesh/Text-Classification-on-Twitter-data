# Text-Classification-on-Twitter-data
This project implements and compares two text classification algorithms, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, on a dataset of social media posts from Twitter. The goal is to predict the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) of tweets using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
